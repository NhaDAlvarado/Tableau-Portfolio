# eCommerce Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores the eCommerce dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrishtimanja/ecommerce-dataset-for-data-analysis). The dataset provides insights into customer orders, product performance, and sales trends, making it an excellent resource for applying data analysis techniques.

The primary goals of this project are:

- To analyze key metrics such as revenue, order trends, and customer behavior.
- To visualize findings through interactive dashboards.
- To apply SQL and Tableau skills to extract meaningful insights.

## Why I Chose This Project

The eCommerce sector is a dynamic and rapidly growing field, offering valuable data that highlights trends in customer purchasing behavior and operational performance. This dataset presents a perfect opportunity to hone my SQL skills for data manipulation and my Tableau expertise for creating compelling visualizations.

By working on this project, I aim to develop a deeper understanding of:

- Sales and product performance metrics.
- Customer behavior and order trends.
- Best practices for data visualization and storytelling.

## Key Learnings

This analysis provided me with valuable insights into:

1. **SQL Proficiency**: Writing efficient queries for data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis. The process involved:
   - Extracting and summarizing sales data.
   - Performing joins and filtering data to answer business questions.
   - Calculating KPIs like total revenue, average order value, and product performance.
2. **Data Visualization with Tableau**: Translating raw data into engaging and interactive dashboards. The dashboards highlight:

   - Revenue trends over time.
   - Top-performing products and categories.
   - Customer order behavior and segmentation.
