# Data Mart Case Study: Visualizing the Impact of Sustainable Business Changes

## Introduction

In an era where sustainability is a business imperative, the **Data Mart case study** presented a perfect opportunity to explore the intersection of business operations and sustainable practices. This case study focuses on the sales performance of an international supermarket and analyzes how the adoption of sustainable packaging in June 2020 impacted different areas of the business, including platforms, regions, and customer demographics.

## Why I Took On This Case Study

I’ve always been interested in how businesses adapt to sustainability while maintaining performance, and I wanted to use this case study to:

- Sharpen my data visualization skills using Tableau.
- Understand the real-world implications of operational changes.
- Provide actionable insights by making the analysis more accessible through interactive visualizations.

## Tableau Visualizations

### **1. Before & After Analysis (n Weeks Before and After June 15, 2020)**

One of the central questions in this case study was to assess how sales were impacted by sustainable packaging changes in June 2020. To effectively visualize this, I created a series of **time series line charts** and **bar charts** that compare total sales **n weeks before and after** June 15, 2020.

- **Interactive Line Chart:** This chart allows you to adjust the number of weeks before and after the key date and see the trends in sales performance over time. The chart displays fluctuations in sales and highlights any significant changes after the switch to sustainable packaging.
- **Bar Chart:** The bar chart breaks down the total sales by **platform** (Retail vs Shopify), **region**, and **customer type** (new vs existing). This enables a clear comparison of which regions and platforms were most affected by the changes.

### **2. Sales by Region & Platform Breakdown**

A key part of the analysis involves comparing the sales performance across regions and platforms. To visualize this:

- **Donut Charts:** Multiple donut charts display the proportion of total sales contributed by each region (e.g., North America, Europe, Oceania). Each donut chart is segmented by the sales platform (Retail vs Shopify), showing the split for each region. This helps in visually identifying regions where sales shifted significantly after June 2020.
- **Stacked Bar Charts:** This visualization shows how different customer types (New vs Existing) and platforms performed before and after the sustainability changes. By segmenting sales by both time and customer types, this visualization answers questions like: “Did new customers decrease after the changes?” or “Did Retail sales take a larger hit compared to Shopify?”

### **3. Demographic Performance: Couples, Families, Unknown**

In this part of the visualization, I explored how different **customer demographics** (e.g., Couples, Families, Unknown) responded to the changes in business operations.

- **Heatmaps:** Heatmaps provide a visual breakdown of how the three main demographics performed across time, highlighting which group showed the highest or lowest sales in the periods before and after the sustainability change. This allows for easy identification of any demographic group that might need further focus or support in the marketing strategy.
- **Pie Charts:** These pie charts illustrate the percentage contribution of each demographic group to the overall sales. This visualization helps in determining if certain customer segments, like **Couples** or **Families**, were more resilient to the changes or if their buying behavior was significantly impacted.

### **4. Recommendations and Insights Dashboard**

The **Recommendations Dashboard** aggregates key insights derived from the comparative analysis:

- **Comparison of Pre- and Post-2020 Metrics:** This part of the dashboard consolidates the growth rate (or decline) in sales across regions, platforms, and demographics for the 4-week and 12-week periods before and after June 2020.
- **Key Insights for Future Business Decisions:** The dashboard provides visual cues (via color coding and annotations) to suggest which areas of the business were most negatively impacted and where future sustainability changes might need to be introduced more carefully to minimize disruptions.

## What I Learned

### Data Visualization & Storytelling

This project provided a great opportunity to practice **data storytelling** using Tableau. I learned how to make visualizations that not only convey numbers but also help users explore the **before and after** effects of significant business changes.

### Comparative Analysis of Sales Trends

The use of **time series analysis** and comparative visualizations in Tableau allowed me to draw clear conclusions about how sustainable changes affected different business units, customer types, and sales platforms. These insights can be directly translated into actionable strategies for mitigating the negative impacts of future changes.

### Importance of Interactivity in Dashboards

Tableau's ability to create interactive, user-driven dashboards helped me understand the importance of allowing stakeholders to **explore data dynamically**. Whether it's adjusting the number of weeks or filtering by customer segments, these interactive elements make the insights more actionable and accessible.

## Conclusion

This case study was a deep dive into how sustainable business practices can influence sales across different dimensions. By focusing on **interactive visualizations** in Tableau, I was able to uncover critical insights that could help businesses make informed decisions when implementing sustainability initiatives. Going forward, I’m excited to continue using data visualization tools like Tableau to tell more meaningful stories that drive business strategies.
