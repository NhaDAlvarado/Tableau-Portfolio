# Mental Health Dataset Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the [Mental Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/mental-health-dataset) using SQL for in-depth data analysis and Tableau for data visualization. The goal is to uncover insights into mental health trends, factors, and patterns to better understand the impact on various demographics.

### Project Objectives

- Utilize **SQL** for data cleaning, analysis, and extracting meaningful insights.
- Leverage **Tableau** to create visualizations that effectively communicate findings.
- Identify key factors affecting mental health across different groups and analyze trends over time.

## Why I Chose This Project

Mental health is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of well-being, especially in today's fast-paced world. By exploring this dataset, I aim to highlight important trends and provide actionable insights that can contribute to a better understanding of mental health issues. This project allows me to apply my SQL and Tableau skills to a topic that has significant societal relevance.

## Key Learnings

Through this project, I will:

- Strengthen my **SQL** skills by performing complex queries and analysis on real-world data.
- Enhance my **Tableau** skills by building interactive and insightful visualizations.
- Gain a deeper understanding of the challenges associated with mental health data, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and deriving meaningful insights from raw data.
- Learn to effectively communicate data-driven insights through visual storytelling.
