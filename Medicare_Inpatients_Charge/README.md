# **Medicare Inpatient Charges Analysis**

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the **Medicare Inpatient Charges** dataset, which is part of the **Google Cloud Public Datasets** under the healthcare section. The dataset contains detailed information about hospital charges, Medicare payments, and provider details for inpatient services across the United States.

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze healthcare data to uncover insights that can improve hospital performance, optimize Medicare payments, and inform policy decisions. By leveraging **Google BigQuery**, I aim to handle the large dataset efficiently and perform advanced analytics to answer key questions about healthcare costs and provider performance.

## **Why This Project?**

I chose this project for the following reasons:

1. **Interest in Healthcare Analytics**: I am passionate about healthcare and want to develop skills in analyzing healthcare data to improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
2. **Large Dataset**: The dataset is massive, making it an excellent opportunity to work with **Google BigQuery**, a powerful tool for handling big data.
3. **Real-World Impact**: By analyzing Medicare charges and payments, I aim to identify trends and disparities that can help hospitals and policymakers make data-driven decisions.
4. **Skill Development**: This project allows me to practice SQL, data visualization, and storytelling with data, which are essential skills for a healthcare analyst.

## **Key Questions to Explore**

1. What are the average covered charges and Medicare payments for different medical conditions (DRG definitions)?
2. Which hospitals have the highest and lowest average charges and payments?
3. How do charges and payments vary by state or region?
4. Are there disparities in charges and payments between urban and rural hospitals?
5. What is the relationship between total discharges and Medicare payments?
6. Which medical conditions have the highest and lowest Medicare payments?
7. How can hospitals optimize their charges to improve performance and reduce costs?

## **How This Analysis Will Help Improve Performance**

The insights from this analysis can help:

1. **Hospitals**: Identify areas where charges can be optimized to align with Medicare payments, improving financial performance.
2. **Policymakers**: Understand regional disparities in healthcare costs and design policies to address them.
3. **Patients**: Gain transparency into hospital charges and Medicare payments, helping them make informed decisions.
4. **Healthcare Providers**: Benchmark their performance against national averages and identify best practices.
