# Restaurant Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing restaurant data obtained from the [Restaurants Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/graphquest/restaurants). The dataset contains valuable insights about various restaurants, their locations, cuisines, ratings, and more. By diving into this dataset, I aim to uncover trends and actionable insights related to the restaurant industry, which can inform decision-making for both business owners and consumers.

## Why This Project?

I chose this project because the restaurant industry is a dynamic and customer-centric sector that combines both art and science. I have always been intrigued by the trends that shape dining experiences and how data can reveal hidden stories behind customer preferences and restaurant performance. This project offers me an excellent opportunity to combine my passion for data analysis and visualization while addressing real-world challenges faced by the food and beverage industry.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Data Cleaning:** Practice organizing and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing data, duplicates, and outliers.
- **SQL Analysis:** Strengthen my SQL skills by querying the data to answer specific business questions, such as identifying top-rated cuisines, analyzing geographic performance, and uncovering customer preferences.
- **Data Visualization:** Develop and showcase my Tableau visualization skills by creating interactive dashboards that effectively communicate the insights from the data.
- **Insight Generation:** Learn to interpret results critically and derive actionable recommendations for stakeholders.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **SQL:** For querying and data analysis.
- **Tableau:** To create interactive and visually appealing dashboards. Check out my Tableau visualizations for this project and others on my [Tableau Public Profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nha.alvarado/viz).
- **Python/R:** (Optional, depending on further analysis) for advanced data cleaning or statistical analysis.

## Source

## Future Plans

This project is just the beginning of exploring how data can shape industries. As I progress, I plan to:

- Expand the analysis to include time-series trends if time-based data is available.
- Integrate external datasets (e.g., customer reviews or local demographics) to enrich insights.
- Apply machine learning techniques to predict restaurant success factors.

## Acknowledgements
