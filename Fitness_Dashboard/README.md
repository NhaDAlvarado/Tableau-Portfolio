# Mental Health and Fitness Analysis Project

## Overview

This project leverages the **Gym Members Exercise Dataset** from Kaggle to explore the relationship between fitness activities, physiological metrics, and overall well-being. The dataset provides detailed insights into gym members' workout routines, health metrics, and fitness levels. Using **SQL** for data analysis and **Tableau** for visualization, this project aims to uncover meaningful trends and insights that can guide individuals and fitness professionals in improving mental and physical health outcomes.

## Why I Chose This Project

Understanding the interplay between physical activity and mental health is critical in today's fast-paced world. As fitness trends evolve, analyzing real-world data helps answer key questions like:

- How do different types of workouts impact physical health metrics such as BMI, heart rate, or calories burned?
- What role do exercise frequency and duration play in achieving fitness goals?
- How can fitness data inform personalized mental health and wellness strategies?

This project bridges my passion for **data-driven storytelling** and **promoting holistic well-being**. It also allows me to sharpen my SQL and Tableau skills while contributing actionable insights in the realm of fitness and mental health.

## What I Will Learn

Through this project, I aim to:

1. **Data Analysis with SQL**

   - Clean and preprocess raw fitness data.
   - Identify trends and patterns in gym members' health metrics and workout routines.
   - Execute complex queries to answer business-critical questions related to fitness performance and goals.

2. **Visualization with Tableau**

   - Create interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends.
   - Present insights in an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing manner.
   - Develop storytelling techniques that convey the importance of mental and physical health data.

3. **Real-World Application**
   - Gain insights into improving fitness strategies based on data-driven evidence.
   - Understand how to tailor fitness routines to promote mental and physical health benefits.

## Project Goals

- **Analysis:** Use SQL to explore and process the dataset, focusing on key areas such as workout types, frequency, and calorie burn trends.
- **Visualization:** Develop Tableau dashboards to highlight patterns, correlations, and actionable insights for improving fitness outcomes.
- **Impact:** Deliver insights that empower individuals to adopt healthier workout routines and promote overall well-being.
