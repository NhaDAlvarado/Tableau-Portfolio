# Inside Airbnb: San Francisco Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Airbnb listings in San Francisco**, sourced from the [Inside Airbnb project](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). As one of the top tourist destinations, San Francisco's housing market has been significantly impacted by the rise of short-term rentals like Airbnb. The aim of this project is to gain insights into the distribution, pricing, and availability of these listings across the city through SQL queries and Tableau visualizations.

The dataset provides a wealth of information, including listing prices, locations, availability, and host details. These variables will be explored through structured queries and interactive visualizations to uncover important trends and patterns.

## Why Choose This Project?

This project was chosen for several key reasons:

1. **Housing Market Relevance**: San Francisco is at the center of many discussions about housing affordability and short-term rentals. Analyzing Airbnb data helps provide a better understanding of how short-term rentals may be influencing the housing market and urban landscape.
2. **SQL and Tableau Proficiency**: This project offers the opportunity to apply and showcase my SQL querying skills for data extraction and cleaning. Additionally, I will use **Tableau** to build interactive dashboards that provide an engaging way to present insights.
3. **Practical Insights**: The analysis will allow us to explore neighborhood-level impacts, pricing strategies, and availability trends, all of which are relevant to property owners, renters, and policymakers.

## What Will I Learn?

In this project, I will:

- **Query Airbnb Data with SQL**: Using SQL, I will extract key information from the dataset, such as average prices by neighborhood, the number of listings per host, and availability trends over time. SQL will also be used for data cleaning, transformation, and advanced filtering.
- **Visualize Data in Tableau**: By creating interactive dashboards in Tableau, I will bring the dataset to life. Visualizations will include maps of listing density, price distribution, and availability patterns across San Francisco.
- **Gain Market Insights**: Through the combination of SQL analysis and Tableau visualizations, I will learn how Airbnb listings are affecting different areas of the city, and whether hosts are concentrated in certain neighborhoods or price ranges.
- **Identify Trends and Patterns**: I will analyze how rental prices, availability, and host activity change over time, revealing seasonal or long-term trends in the market.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the [Inside Airbnb website](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) and contains detailed information about listings in San Francisco.

- **Dataset link**: [Inside Airbnb Data](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)
- **File used**: `listings.csv` (Includes detailed attributes such as price, location, availability, host information, and more)

## Project Structure

- **Data Preparation**: Use SQL queries to clean and prepare the dataset by removing null values, standardizing formats, and filtering for relevant records.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory analysis using SQL to understand the basic patterns and characteristics of the data.
- **Tableau Dashboards**: Develop interactive dashboards that visualize key insights, such as:
  - Geographic distribution of Airbnb listings
  - Average price per neighborhood
  - Availability trends over time
  - Host activity (single vs. multi-listing hosts)
- **Insights and Reporting**: Summarize the insights gained from the SQL queries and Tableau visualizations, highlighting important trends in the Airbnb market in San Francisco.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: For querying and manipulating the dataset to extract meaningful information.
- **Tableau**: For creating visualizations and dashboards that present the findings in a clear and interactive way.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, I will have gained a deep understanding of the Airbnb market in San Francisco. The combination of SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visualization will enable me to communicate complex insights effectively. This project will enhance my proficiency in data querying and dashboard creation, key skills for any data-driven role.
