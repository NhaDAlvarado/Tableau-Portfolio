# Car Rental Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Cornell Car Rental dataset using SQL for data analysis and Tableau for visualization. The goal is to uncover insights into the car rental industry, such as trends in fuel types, rental pricing, customer preferences, and geographic distribution of car rentals.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Cornell Car Rental Datase](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kushleshkumar/cornell-car-rental-dataset), which can be found on Kaggle.

The dataset includes information such as:

- Car specifications (fuel type, make, model, year)
- Rental details (daily rate, trips taken, reviews)
- Location data (city, state, country, coordinates)
- Owner information

## Why I Chose This Project

As someone passionate about data analysis, I wanted to dive into a real-world dataset that combines business metrics, customer behavior, and geographic insights. The car rental industry, with its wide range of variables—such as pricing, customer preferences, and location-based trends—presents a fascinating opportunity to hone my skills in SQL and Tableau.

I believe that understanding such complex datasets will help me become a more versatile data professional, especially in roles that require end-to-end data analysis and presentation of findings to stakeholders.

## What I Will Learn

Through this project, I aim to:

- **Strengthen my SQL skills**: By writing complex queries to explore trends, calculate statistics, and perform data transformations.
- **Improve my Tableau proficiency**: By creating interactive dashboards that visualize the insights derived from the dataset.
- **Gain industry-specific insights**: Learn about the car rental market, customer preferences, and how location plays a role in pricing and availability.
- **Enhance data storytelling**: Develop my ability to communicate data-driven insights in a clear and compelling way.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
   - Using SQL to explore and clean the dataset, addressing issues like missing data and outliers.
2. **Analysis**:

   - Writing SQL queries to analyze:
     - Average daily rates for different car types
     - Correlations between rental price and location
     - Trends in customer ratings and reviews

3. **Visualization**:
   - Creating Tableau dashboards to visually present the findings:
     - Price distribution by city and state
     - Vehicle preferences based on location and fuel type
     - Customer satisfaction trends

## Tools

- **SQL**: For data querying and analysis.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.

## Conclusion

This project not only allows me to dive into a dataset that is rich in real-world insights but also helps me sharpen my technical skills in SQL and Tableau. By the end of this project, I aim to have a strong understanding of car rental industry patterns and the ability to present my findings in a way that tells a meaningful story.
