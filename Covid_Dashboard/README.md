# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project leverages datasets from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) to explore critical aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The two datasets used are:

- **CovidVaccinations.csv**: This dataset contains information about vaccination rollouts worldwide.
- **CovidDeaths.csv**: This dataset provides details about COVID-19 deaths across different countries and regions.

By combining these datasets, the project aims to uncover insights into how vaccination efforts impacted mortality rates globally and regionally.

## Why I Chose This Project

COVID-19 has been a defining event of our time, profoundly affecting millions of lives. As someone passionate about data analysis, I believe that exploring such impactful data is an opportunity to better understand the pandemic's dynamics and to contribute to meaningful insights. Through this project, I aim to:

- **Understand Trends**: Investigate the temporal and spatial trends of COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations.
- **Draw Connections**: Analyze relationships between vaccination rates and mortality trends.
- **Enhance Skills**: Improve my ability to clean, visualize, and interpret real-world datasets.

This project is personal to me because it allows me to connect my analytical skills with a topic of global significance. I hope this analysis can be a small step toward understanding what worked during the pandemic and what could be improved for future health crises.

## What I Will Learn

By completing this project, I plan to:

### Data Wrangling

- Gain experience in handling real-world data, including cleaning and preprocessing datasets to make them analysis-ready.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Explore trends, patterns, and correlations within the datasets using Python and SQL.

### Data Visualization

- Create intuitive visualizations to communicate findings effectively. This will likely involve tools like Tableau or Matplotlib/Seaborn.

### Insights and Storytelling

- Practice deriving actionable insights from data and presenting them in a compelling narrative format.
