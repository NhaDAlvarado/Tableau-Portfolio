# Sales & Customer Analysis Dashboards

## Introduction

This project outlines the creation of two Tableau dashboards designed to help stakeholders, including sales managers and executives, analyze sales performance and customer data. The dashboards provide critical insights into key performance metrics, trends, and customer behavior.

### 1. Sales Dashboard

The sales dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of sales metrics, helping stakeholders analyze year-over-year performance, track monthly and weekly sales trends, and compare product subcategories. The dashboard also highlights high and low-performing periods, making it easy to identify key areas for improvement.

### 2. Customer Dashboard

The customer dashboard provides insights into customer behavior, trends, and segmentation. It includes detailed KPIs, customer distribution by order volume, and identifies the top 10 customers by profit. This dashboard helps marketing teams and management enhance customer satisfaction and engagement.

## Why I Chose This Project

Inspired by [Data with Baraa](https://www.datawithbaraa.com/tableau/tableau-project-sales-performance/) and his [YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3pXnbniUcM). I wanted to challenge myself with a project that combined data visualization with actionable business insights. This project allowed me to bring together sales and customer analysis in a way that could genuinely benefit stakeholders by helping them make informed decisions. My goal was to create dynamic, interactive dashboards that not only present data but also tell a story that stakeholders can engage with.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of Tableau’s capabilities, including:

- Designing interactive and dynamic dashboards with filters for better user experience.
- Analyzing and visualizing key metrics such as sales performance, customer behavior, and trends.
- Improving my data storytelling skills by making complex data easier to understand for stakeholders.

This project was a rewarding learning experience, and I’m excited to continue building on these skills in future Tableau projects.
