# Churn Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project dives into analyzing and predicting customer churn for a bank, utilizing the **Bank Customer Churn Prediction Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/bank-customer-churn-prediction-dataset/data). The dataset includes key customer information, financial behaviors, and demographics, offering a comprehensive base for understanding patterns in customer attrition.

**Dataset Highlights**:

- Customer demographic information
- Financial metrics like credit score, balance, and estimated salary
- Behavioral factors like tenure, product usage, and active membership

## Why I Chose This Project

Understanding why customers leave is a valuable skill in the data-driven field of customer retention. With my background in data analysis, I wanted to deepen my skills in exploring customer behavioral data and apply SQL and Tableau for a realistic scenario. This project allows me to:

1. Hone my skills in identifying significant patterns through SQL queries.
2. Use Tableau to create compelling visualizations that communicate insights clearly and interactively.

## Project Goals and Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aim to:

1. **Analyze** churn trends by exploring various customer segments like age, gender, tenure, and geography.
2. **Visualize** data interactively with Tableau, making it easy for stakeholders to identify patterns at a glance.

In addition to technical skills, this project has also been an opportunity to practice storytelling with data, creating visuals that highlight key insights into customer behavior.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing and cleaning the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using SQL queries to answer specific questions about customer demographics, financial behavior, and churn-related factors.
3. **Visualization with Tableau**: Developing interactive dashboards to illustrate key findings. Access the full interactive dashboard here: [My Tableau Public Profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nha.alvarado/vizzes).

## Key Insights

Some of the primary insights uncovered in the project include:

- **Churn by Demographics**: Age, geography, and gender impact churn rates, with older customers and specific locations showing higher churn rates.
- **Product Engagement**: Customers with multiple products or higher tenure tend to stay longer.
- **Financial Patterns**: High balance customers are more likely to churn, highlighting potential issues in engaging affluent customers.

## Visualizations

The visualizations in this project bring these insights to life, allowing us to see trends in churn by various factors. For a full interactive experience, check out my [Tableau Public link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nha.alvarado/vizzes).
